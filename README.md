# my-top-artists-web-app
Originally, a Web Application application designed to show a Spotify Users' top played artists. I had ran into some trouble implementing the User Login feature. So I back tracked and changed my methods so the app would GET new releases in the united states and display that information,
so that I could have an application that works and displays data for my project.

For my three implimented features:
My project consists of using a MVC to consume the Spotify API and organize and display all the new releases in the United States. It displays the artists name, album image, and spotify link
It displays the data on parameters such as country and recent release.
